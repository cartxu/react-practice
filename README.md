These are just some of my practices with React :)

<ol>
  <li> <strong> <a href="https://cartxu.github.io/react-practice/counter" target="_blank"> Counter: </a></strong> Just a simple counter which increments its value when the user clicks on the button. </li>
  <li> <strong> <a href="https://cartxu.github.io/react-practice/game" target="_blank"> Math Game: </a></strong> Interactive math game. The user must resolve the sum, if the result is correct, one point is added to the score, if is wrong, one point is lost. When the user reaches 10 points, there's a victory! </li>
   <li> <strong> <a href="https://cartxu.github.io/react-practice/tictactoe" target="_blank"> Tic Tac Toe Game: </a></strong> Tic Tac Toe game made with react. You can go back to the previous moves with the bottoms on the right! </li>

</ol>
